//spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none

None - revoke all privileges from the MySQL user connected to the Spring application, 

//GRANT INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE ON `911`.* TO '911_operator'@'localhost';
ONLY SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE operations

Gives our application only the privileges necessary to make changes to ONLY the data of the database and not the structure (schema).
